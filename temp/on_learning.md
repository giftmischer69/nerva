# thoughts on learning, and learning-culture

there are many situations in life in which other people can help you. however,
there are also situations that you have to cope with alone. when a child is
born, for example, the woman has to give birth to the child alone, even if the
man supports her in the best possible way.

you can also be supported in learning, but the connections have to be made in
your own head.

in my current journey through the it business world, i have often observed that
employees are often sent on a one-week training course before they even
get to grips with the topic. 

learning has to be an intrinsic action, done for interest of the topic
