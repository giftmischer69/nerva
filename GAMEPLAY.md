Mildra
A fancy steel box containing a single silver foil patch, which smells like asphalt. There is a drug information label, but it is written in an alien script. When you apply this patch to your skin, your eyes become bloodshot, but nothing else happens. For some type of aliens however, it is highly addictive.

B-220
Five steel foil patches in a corroded tin box labeled "No Refills". A faded label describes this drug as a placebo, but exposure to cosmic rays has altered it. When you apply one of these patches to your skin, you do not need to eat or drink for the next five days.

Jackson Jesse Juda
A partial blister pack holding a single white gel capsule, marked with a double-helix. An attached prescription describes this drug as a hallucinogen, but it has been warped by rogue nanobots. When you swallow this capsule, you feel powerful and indestructible for the next three hours.

SGO-44
A battered case containing a single clear plastic patch, marked with a double-helix. When you apply this patch to your skin, you don't require any sleep for the next 24 hours.
