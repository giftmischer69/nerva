## the universe






## visual novel

> A visual novel is basically an interactive book with mostly erotic content, where the player has to make situational decisions to advance the story. In the process, new routes are created and in most cases there are also different ways to end the game. The choices made as a player can take the game experience in a completely different direction, resulting in both positive and negative endings for the player.
